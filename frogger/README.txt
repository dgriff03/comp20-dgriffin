README

I believe that most of this site is implmented correctly although some of
the images may be off by a set amount of pixels. Overall it seems to meet
specifications

There was no collaboration on this project.

This project took approximatedly 2 1/2 hours


EDIT:

added animation
Made page load immediately
Frogger moves with up down left right
animated logs and cars
detects collisions -- car or water is death, log moves with log
scores with according to each up = 10pts,across = 100pts 5 across =1000

extras:
Scores with timing
if time out -- death if time out
if go off map, hit car, hit water then animated death
if 5 across upgrades level, increases speed


issues:
does not keep frog on pad across river, can reland on spot across the river
High Score does not update
when moving doesn't jump, animates by direction
if too high a level, then wont detect collision due to skipping past
