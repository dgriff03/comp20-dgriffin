			Many online games now keep tally of the top ten high scores of any number of players. Having one site which can store all the scores of multiple games in an online database allows for easy implementation of high score storage. A website for game score data storage was created under the name Scorecenter.  This data storage site allows for any site to post its game score by game title, the user’s name and finally the score. The site then further allows the user to pull the top ten scores associated with their game title. It is also possible to search all scores by username to find all of a user’s scores.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scorecenter wished to have any security issues found so that its scores will be tracked with integrity and the site will have no issues running. This is important as games wish to report actual scores stored and if the database became corrupted then any game which pulled data from the site would be at risk for malfunction. Presented below is a listing of the security issues found with the current state of Scorecenter and some suggestions for improvement to the application.
		</p>
		<a name = "Methodology"></a><h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>
			The site Scorecenter is available at: <a href ='http://scorecenter-je.herokuapp.com/'>Scorecenter</a>. When attacking the site I had access to the site’s source code.
		</p>
		<p>
			To test the site the code was compiled and run locally so as to prevent any permanent damage to the site. The first test was to write a quick html file locally with a post form to the site. This file was then used as the main testing ground for errors. This checked if there was a “white list” of sites that were allowed to post to the database or if any site could access it. From here the site was tested on its handling of large text-blocks, html text and javascript. The results from searches were also analyzed for possible security issues. Finally, the source code was examined for further security issues. All of these issues were compiled and tested.
		</p>
		<p>
			Software: As of this point the only software used to find these security issues are the html file written to POST to the site and the Sublime Text 2 to view the source code.

		<p><div class="indent">
			The Scorecenter website was found to have three main issues with security. The issues that will be addressed are: information output, source validation and input validation. Bellow these issues are broken down.
			<h3>Information Output</h3>
			<p>
			This site outputs all information about the users when a request is made for a specific game. While this may initially seam innocuous, the site gives more information than is needed. The output information includes the user’s database id which is could have no use except for those with malicious intent.
			</p>
			<h3>Source Validation</h3>
			<p>
			Scorecenter allows for information from any site to be added to the database without any verification. Although at first this may seem useful as it allows for any new game to immediately use the site there are severe drawbacks. This allows for anyone to add ANYTHING to the database. This means that new tags not including game_titile, username, and score to be could be added with any data. Second, it creates a lack of integrity in the scores within the system as any person can merely POST a score to the system. This score would get added to the system and reported to any game using the system.  However, even more seriously, it allows for people to easily exploit the security flaws inherit in a lack of input validation. 
			</p>
			<h3>Input Validation</h3>
			<p>
			This issue is certainly the most serious offense of all present. It is important to note that this issue would remain a serious flow even if the source validation issue was addressed. The input is not checked in any manner for any of the many issues that could occur. The first issue that is the simplest is the type of input that is submitted. This can lead to corruption of data, in example if a person submitted the work “milk” as a score. The second issue with this is a lack of size check. This should both be implemented in the display and input. This is an issue as a username or game title of a large size destroys the appearance of site.Lastly, code can be submitted into the database which allows has many inherent issues. If this is submitted in the username or game title then it would be displayed on the site. This would result in possible addition of ads or popups. This is a further issue as if these values were returned to a game, it could corrupt the games as well as the site.
