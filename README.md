This repository is a compilation of projects for the Web Programming Class, computer science 20, at Tufts University Department of Computer Science

My favorite project for this class was assignment number 3, which is the google maps implementation of mapping the MBTA red line. This is the project within
the where folder. It was a very rewarding project which early into the course demonstrated the true power of the code we were learning.

I the project I am most proud of is the above maps project as it demonstrated that the code that I was learning had real world applications. While writing
the code for this project I was constantly learning how to handle different aspects of javascript. The amount of code produced was not proportional to the
amount of time spent as much of my time was spent learning the code as I was writting it.

Over this course I have learned html,css, javascript, and the beginings of how to make web applications. However, the most important take away from this course
to me is the ability to learn a new laungage through my own research.
